# BUILD LOG

## September 22, 2023

* In doing some research, if I plan to build out components using anything other than Google analytics, I'll either have to pay for an account, ask for a developer account, or host it myself. If I pay for hosting, I might as well pay for the service, although it could be cheaper.
* Here's what I've thought to far about this:
  * I could just bite the bullet on this and try with google, or a free alternative like cloudflare or posthog
  * If I wanted to self host, I could get free credits on AWS, Google, Oracle, Azure, Linode, or Digital Oceans
  * Upon further research, it's probably even easier if I used a container service instead of a whole VPS. AWS has one, docker and github both have free ones, probably the easiest thing to do.
* For now I think I'll just start with Posthog, I like the look of their product and their community looks very indie focused. I'll start looking into the container hosting so I can try with Plausible next.
